# Token Generator Project

A simple and easy-to-use smart contract generator for creating ERC-20 (ETH), BEP-20 (BSC), and Solana tokens. Users can easily create their custom tokens by specifying the name, symbol, supply, and decimals. The project supports token creation, deployment via MetaMask, and payment of a small fee for contract generation.

## Features
- Create **ERC-20** tokens for Ethereum
- Create **BEP-20** tokens for Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- Simple user interface to enter token details
- Deploy tokens directly to the network using MetaMask
- Pay a small fee (0.2 BNB or equivalent in ETH) to generate and deploy the contract
- Supports token creation on **ETH** and **BSC** networks
- Ability to interact with deployed contracts using Web3.js

## Prerequisites

Before using the project, you need the following:
- **MetaMask**: To connect your wallet and pay fees for contract deployment.
- **Python 3.6+**: Required for running the backend.
- **Node.js & npm**: Required for running frontend dependencies like Web3.js.

### Setup Instructions
